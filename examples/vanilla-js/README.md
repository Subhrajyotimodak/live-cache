# Vanilla JavaScript Example

This example demonstrates how to use LiveCache in a plain HTML/JavaScript environment.

## How to Run

1. First, build the library from the root directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   - You can simply double-click the file, or
   - Use a local server: `python -m http.server 8000` or `npx serve`

## What It Does

This example shows:
- How to load the library using the UMD build
- Creating sandwich instances
- Calling library methods
- Updating sandwich properties
- Using the library's API in a vanilla JS context

The library is available as a global `LiveCache` object when loaded via the UMD build.
